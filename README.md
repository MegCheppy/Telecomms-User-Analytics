# Telecomms-User-Analytics
You are working for a wealthy investor that specialises in purchasing assets that are undervalued.
The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia.  TellCoâ€™s current owners have been willing to share their financial information but have never employed anyone to look at their data that is generated automatically by their systems.

Your employer wants you to provide a report to analyse opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  You will do this by analysing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network. You will deliver insights you managed to extract to your employer through an easy to use web based dashboard and a written report.
